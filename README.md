The main aim of the Project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Perform cleaning and perform predictions from the Health insurance Dataset.

Imported various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib into Google Collab and Readed the Health insurance dataset using read_csv() function .we gone ahead in observing the dataset's unique values in every column separately.

While observing every column separately, we observed the values which are wrongly typed or in some values in which the values should be dropped, we cleaned the data accordingly.

while performing Exploratory data analysis, we performed univariate analysis, correlation between data using heatmap and listed down the observations accordingly.

While performing Feauture engineering, we performed encoding using label encoder, performed variance inflation factor for checking which variables to be taken for performing machine learning algorithms.

While splitting the data according the vif factors previously checked, we selected the x and y columns accordingly, performed scaling using standard scalar and performed predictions using logistic regression, knn, decision tree and random forest.
